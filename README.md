# SchemeVisualisation-2016
SPICE Scheme Visualisation for my father in Seemens:)

SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a general-purpose, open source analog electronic circuit simulator. It is a program used in integrated circuit and board-level design to check the integrity of circuit designs and to predict circuit behavior.

# Task
1. Parse SPICE files 
2. Try various methods of graph visualization to symplify understanding of sheme configuration for developers  
3. Implement basic functions such as scaling on graph, searching for nodes

# Instruments
Visual Studio 2010 - C#
